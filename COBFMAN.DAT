+ _________________________
- FUNCTION:
+ ________
     THIS UTILITY ACCEPTS AS INPUT A COBOL SOURCE PROGRAM AND OUTPUTS
     THE SAME PROGRAM REFORMATTED.  BLANK LINES ARE INSERTED WHERE
     APPROPRIATE AND INDENTATION IS MADE, UP TO SIX LEVELS.  THE
     UTILITY CAN BE USED TO MAKE OLD PROGRAMS WHICH WERE NEVER
     PROPERLY FORMATED MORE READABLE, OR IT CAN FORMAT NEW COBOL
     PROGRAMS WHICH CAN BE TYPED IN A FREE FORMAT MANNER.  NORMALLY,
     ONLY COLUMNS 7-72 ARE USED FOR THE INPUT PROGRAM, BUT BY
     INDICATING WIDE_MARGINS AS AN OPTION COLUMNS 7-80 MAY BE USED.
     (COLUMN 7 IS RESERVED FOR INDICATING COMMENTS, CONTINUATION AND
     THE CASE CONSTRUCT WHETHER WIDE_MARGINS IS SPECIFIED OR NOT).
     THIS MAKES TYPING NEW PROGRAMS MUCH EASIER AS ONE NEED ONLY TYPE
     THE WORDS IN ORDER AND THE FORMATTER WILL ARRANGE THEM INTO THE
     PROPER FORM.
- PARTIAL PROGRAMS:
+ ________________
     PARTIAL PROGRAMS MAY BE REFORMATTED PROVIDED ONE OF THE DIVISION
     NAMES (IE. IDENTIFICATION, DATA, ENVIRONMENT, OR PROCEDURE) IS
     PLACED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CODE TO INDICATE TO THE FORMATTER
     HOW TO PROCESS THE PARTIAL PROGRAM.  THIS SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED
     WITH THE DATA_DIVISION_ONLY AND PROCEDURE_DIVISION_ONLY COMMANDS
     WHICH CAUSE PARTIAL PROCESSING OF A WHOLE PROGRAM.
- WARNING:
+ _______
       THE WORD ENVIRONMENT IS A FORMATTER KEYWORD AND SHOULD NOT BE
     USED IN THE REMARKS SECTION OF YOUR PROGRAM. IF IT IS USED, THE
     PROCESSING IN THIS AREA OF YOUR PROGRAM MAY BE WRONG.
       A SINGLE OR DOUBLE QUOTE IN THE REMARKS SECTION WILL BE
     INTERPRETED AS THE BEGINNING OF A LITERAL UNLESS THE NO_REMARKS
     OPTION IS SPECIFIED.
- DISCLAIMER:
+ __________
     NO RESULTS OF THIS UTILITY ARE GUARANTEED.  SYNTAX OF OUTPUT
     WILL COPY ANY PUNCTUATION OR SPELLING DEFECTS OF THE INPUT.
     AS THE OUTPUT IS DISTINCT FROM THE INPUT NO RISK IS INVOLVED,
     BUT OUTPUT SHOULD BE INSPECTED BEFORE DELETING THE INPUT.

                    "THEN" AND "ELSE" KEYWORDS IN IF STATEMENTS ARE NOT
                    INDENTED, BUT REMAIN ON THE SAME LEVEL AS THE "IF".
                    STATEMENTS FOLLOWING THESE KEYWORDS WILL BEGIN ON
                    THE NEXT LINE.
0      COMPRESS-SOURCE  THIS IS THE REVERSE FUNCTION OF THE FORMATTER.
+      _______________
                    IT CAUSES THE OUTPUT TO CONTAIN ONE SPACE
                    BETWEEN EACH WORD WITH NO REGARD TO SYNTAX OR
                    MARGINS IN ORDER TO UTILIZE AS LITTLE SPACE AS
                    POSSIBLE.  TO REGAIN THE PROPER FORM, USE THE
                    FORMATTER WITHOUT THIS OPTION SPECIFIED.
                    ONE MAY DESIRE TO SPECIFY NO_COMMENTS WHEN BOTH

                    DIVISION IS REFORMATTED.  FOR PROCESSING TO OCCUR
                    THE DIVISION NAME MUST BEGIN IN COLUMN EIGHT AND
                    THERE MUST BE ONLY ONE SPACE BETWEEN DATA AND
                    DIVISION.  IN ADDITION THE REMAINDER OF THE LINE
                    SHOULD BE BLANK.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS THE
                    NORMAL POSITION FOR THESE WORDS.
0      KEEP-COMMAS  PREVENTS THE DEFAULT OPTION THAT DELETES COMMAS
+      ___________
                    WHILE FORMATTING.
0      KEEP-SPACERS  THIS COMMAND MAY BE USED TO OVERRIDE THE DEFAULT

                    PROCESSING OF THE COBOL FORMAT WORDS EJECT, SKIP1,
                    SKIP2 AND SKIP3.  NORMALLY THESE WORDS ARE DELETED
                    AND BLANK LINES ARE INSERTED FOR THE SKIPS.  WHEN
                    THIS COMMAND IS USED THESE WORDS IN THE PROGRAM
                    ARE LEFT ALONE AND NO ADDITIONAL EJECTS ARE ADDED.

0     4.  SPACERS (IE. SKIP1, SKIP2, SKIP3 AND EJECT) WILL BE
               INTERPRETED IN THE CASE OF LINE SKIPS AND OMITTED IN THE
               CASE OF EJECT.  THE FORMATTER PLACES EJECTS BEFORE THE

0    TO OBTAIN THIS TYPE OF INDENTATION THE USER MUST PLACE A "C"
     (STANDING FOR CASE) IN COLUMN SEVEN OF THE LINE WHICH HAS THE FIRST
     "IF" IN IT.  THIS OPTION IS AUTOMATICALLY RESET WHEN A PERIOD IS
     ENCOUNTERED.  TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THE CASE PROCESSING PLACE A
     LETTER "R" (STANDING FOR REGULAR) IN COLUMN SEVEN OF A LINE WHICH
     HAS AN "IF" IN IT. THIS WILL CAUSE THAT ONE IF STATEMENT TO INDENT
     NORMALLY.  FOLLOWING IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE RESULT OF THIS TYPE OF
     CONTROL.
0      C   IF X = A
               THEN PERFORM B2A1-MAX
           ELSE IF X = B
       R       THEN IF Y = B
                        THEN PERFORM B2B1-MIN
                        ELSE NEXT SENTENCE
           ELSE IF X = C
               THEN PERFORM B2C1-AVG.
0    NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT THE "C" AND "R" WOULD NOT BE REPRODUCED TO
     THE OUTPUT FILE.  NO MANUAL REMOVAL OF THESE CODES IS THEREFORE
     NECESSARY.
0    THE CASE CONSTRUCT (C AND R) WILL ALSO WORK WITH THE ALT_INDENT
     OPTION BUT SOME OF THE CLARITY OF WHAT IS BEING DONE IS LOST.

           THEN
               PERFORM B2A1-MAX

               THEN
